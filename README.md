# Dark_-tealer-V1.0-
While browsing the interent I found this unmarked python file packed away into a seperate folder trying to hides itself as a trojan. I looked into it and found exactly what it was aiming to do. The code is aiming to grab the users disocrd token and save it to the folder. The main executable likely sent the working discord tokens back to the owner of the malware. I found this all incredibly interesting so I decided to publish it all for you to see.
